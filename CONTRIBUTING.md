# Drexel ADS Website - Contribution Instructions

The purpose of this project is to create a central resource for Drexel ADS members to access. It should display all relevant information about previous and planned events, and allow authorized users to update this information.

## General Instructions:
- Every DrexelADS member is eligible to contribute.
- The repository would be publicly accessible.
- Please note that, you won't be directly eligible to merge to the master. Please follow the standard open-source contributing guidelines.
- To get started, clone the repo to your local using ```git clone https://github.com/DrexelADS/ClubWebsite.git```.
- The repository should be available on your local computer.

Our goal is to make this project as accessible as possible. As it's supposed to be a learning opportunity, the contributors aren't expected to have any prior experiences in the tech stack that we are planning to use.

## Getting Started:
- The repository would contain up-to-date code on the main branch.
- The open issues would be available under the ```Issues``` tab.
- We will try to label each issue with the difficulty and expertise required to solve it. Don't worry we will have a lot of beginner-friendly issues.
- Each issue will contain details about what needs to be added and the acceptance criteria. If you want your code to be merged in the main branch, you will have to fulfil all or most of the issue requirements.
- Once you pick an issue, assign it to yourself. Branch out locally and start making changes. Once you are done making changes and feel that your code is ready for review, make a merge request and assign it to any of the managers. All of this will be pretty self-explanatory when you make your first merge request.
- Once you make the merge request, the project managers will review your code and suggest changes if required. Code review is an iterative process and the goal is to prepare your changes for merging.
- Once all the changes have been done, we will merge it to the main branch and know what? It will go into production. :)
- That's it! Pick a new issue and repeat the process.
