# Drexel ADS Website - Requirements Spec
​
The purpose of this project is to create a central resource for Drexel ADS members to access. It should display all relevant information about previous and planned events, and allow authorized users to update this information.
​
## Site Structure
​
 * The site will be divided into several pages. These will be accessible through *tabs*.
 * Upon visiting the site, users will be brought to the home page of the website.
​
## Home Page
​
The landing page of the site is likely the most complex element. In addition to allowing access to each other page through tabs, it should contain a summary of relevant information from the rest of the site.
​
 * The Home page contains information on what (if any) events will be taking place in the near future
 *
​
## Static Elements
​
Some information, such as the club's purpose, does not change. Additionally, information relating to the club's E-board members only changes once a year, when elections occur. This information can be displayed on static pages.
​
 * There shall be an *About* page, detailing the club's purpose and history.
 * There shall be a *FAQ* page, containing information such as "Do I need to be a CS member to join this club?" and "Who is allowed to give presentations?".
 * There shall be an *E-Board* page, containing information on the current E-Board members and how to contact them.
 * There shall be a *Contact* page, containing information on how to submit an issue with the site.
​
## Dynamic Elements
​
Information about the club's events and meetings will change rather often. As such, this information should be editable by authorized users, and visitors to the site should always see the most up to date information.
​
 * There shall be a *Meetings* page, which contains a record of past and planned meetings (including topic, speaker, date/time, and recording if applicable).
 * There shall be a *Guest Speakers* page, containing information on those who have given presentations and hosted events, with links to their respective pages.
 * There shall be an *Events* page, containing information on upcoming and past events outside of regular meetings.
